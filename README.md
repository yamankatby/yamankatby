### Hi there 👋 My name is _Yaman_

Currently working with the great team 🐝 [@invertase](https://github.com/invertase) shipping the feature of 🔥 [Firebase extensions](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions) project.

#### These are some of the projects I made and most proud 🫶 of:

- 🎒 <ins>School Planner</ins> ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swazerlab.schoolplanner), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/school-planner-timetable/id1520179572?platform=iphone)) - a powerful organizer for students' school life.
- ⏰ <ins>Habit Tracker</ins> ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swazer.habittracker), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habit-tracker-focus/id1552899398?platform=iphone)) - Change isn't easy but this app will help you get there.
